As it stands, remember that you need your filename to end in .py, and you can't have any spaces or special characters in the filename like & or ,. So please correct that for the next milestone, so the code can be run easier. For the purposes of this project, I would recommend not worrying about fetching data and instead just provide some dummy data for your project to work with. So I would just create a dictionary or list with some generic weather data for the next module. Perhaps also some dummy calendar data to include on the "mirror display" as well?
