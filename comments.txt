As it stands, remember that you need your filename to end in .py, and you can't have any spaces or special characters in the filename like & or ,. So please correct that for the next milestone, so the code can be run easier. For the purposes of this project, I would recommend not worrying about fetching data and instead just provide some dummy data for your project to work with. So I would just create a dictionary or list with some generic weather data for the next module. Perhaps also some dummy calendar data to include on the "mirror display" as well?
Both calender.py and clock.py produce some kind of output. either can be used as my milestone #2. Both modules lead up to what I would have to create which would be much more complex
