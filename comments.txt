As it stands, remember that you need your filename to end in .py, and you can't have any spaces or special characters in the filename like & or ,. So please correct that for the next milestone, so the code can be run easier. For the purposes of this project, I would recommend not worrying about fetching data and instead just provide some dummy data for your project to work with. So I would just create a dictionary or list with some generic weather data for the next module. Perhaps also some dummy calendar data to include on the "mirror display" as well?
Both calender.py and clock.py produce some kind of output. either can be used as my milestone #2. Both modules lead up to what I would have to create which would be much more complex

In your README, be sure to tell me which file I'm supposed to run because you have three here, and they're not linked. I guess each are supposed to put out different output? Maybe include a main file that ties them all together? I think that's where I'd focus you for the final submission: a Tkinter window that would serve as a prototype for the mirror. I run one command and get an approximation of the mirror. If you'd like to meet one on one about this, please let me know.
