PROJECT OVERVIEW 
My project involved building a smart mirror which is a two way mirror with the capability of displaying 
multimedia data, text, and images. The device would allow user to interact with contextual information, 
such as weather data. I have managed to create a graphic user interface using tkinter to display information such as the date and the time. These widgets put together would help form some type of prototype for the smart mirror. 

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Initially, I began the project by experimenting with modules such as calender and datetime which provided numerous functions to work with dates and time intervals. To reach milestone 1, I worked in one file and attempted to first display the date and the weather--a function which involved outsourcing data. This part taught me about the built-in package Json which is used to transmit and recieve data between a server and a web application. Additionally, I also learned about API keys. During mileston 1, didn't want to jump into anything too difficult so for my calender function I just focused on outputing a simple date (00/00/0000) or a calender for one month of the year. Nothing to fancy or visually pleasing, quite simple. To reach milestone 2, I decided to split each concept into its own file to make project a little less overwhelming. I decided I wanted to create modules for each that would output a screen with an interactive/visual widget for each component---seeing as though the smart mirror would most likely display little widgets for the date, time, and weather. I started out by learning about tkinter. Tkinter is python's standard GUI (graphical user interface) package. I used tkinter to create a window for my calender which outputed the dates for a whole year depending on what year the user enters. I then used tkinter to create a digital clock. I did have difficulty trying to assign colors to the clock through my code (just customizing it in general). As for the weather function, I am having some trouble with the code and outsourcing data for a specific city. If I were to approach the project again, I might focus on divding the work up first to prevent less confusion. I might've even used a different GUI package for python if anything more simple exists. 

CORRECTIONS
After milestone 1, you said I should rememeber to end my filenames with .py so its easier to run. So I changed my filenames and made sure they ended with .py. You also recommended I use dummy data for my calender function. Instead, I just outputed a computer generated calender based on built-in python packages. After milestone 2, you recommended that I told you which file to run in the README cause I had three. You also said I should create a main file which ties everything together. I will attempt to do so, but I am having trouble figuring out the weather function at this moment.
